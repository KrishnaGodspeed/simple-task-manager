# Product Requirements Document: Simple Task Manager API

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27
**Author:** Product Team

## 1. Introduction
The Simple Task Manager API provides backend services for a task management application. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently through a set of RESTful API endpoints.

## 2. Goals
- Provide a reliable and secure API for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
- Ensure data integrity for task information.
- Allow for future scalability and feature additions.

## 3. Target Users
- Developers building frontend applications (web, mobile) for task management.
- Other backend services that might integrate with task data.

## 4. Functional Requirements

| ID    | Requirement                                     | Priority | Status     |
|-------|-------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|
| FR-001| **Create Task:** Users must be able to create a new task with a title, description (optional), and due date (optional). | HIGH     | To Be Implemented |
| FR-002| **Retrieve All Tasks:** Users must be able to retrieve a list of all tasks. Each task in the list should show ID, title, and status. | HIGH     | To Be Implemented |
| FR-003| **Retrieve Single Task:** Users must be able to retrieve detailed information for a specific task by its ID (ID, title, description, due_date, status, created_at, updated_at). | HIGH     | To Be Implemented |
| FR-004| **Update Task:** Users must be able to update the title, description, due date, or status of an existing task. | HIGH     | To Be Implemented |
| FR-005| **Delete Task:** Users must be able to delete a task. | HIGH     | To Be Implemented |
| FR-006| **Task Status:** Tasks should have a status (e.g., "pending", "in progress", "completed"). Default status on creation is "pending". | MEDIUM   | To Be Implemented |
| FR-007| **Input Validation:** All input data must be validated. Titles must not be empty. Due dates, if provided, must be valid dates. | HIGH     | To Be Implemented |
| FR-008| **Timestamping:** Tasks must automatically record `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps. | HIGH     | To Be Implemented |
| FR-009| **Data Privacy for Descriptions:** Task descriptions may contain sensitive project details. Access should be controlled. (Placeholder for future user auth integration) | MEDIUM   | Future     |
| FR-010| **Filtering Tasks:** Users should be able to filter tasks by status (e.g., `/tasks?status=pending`). | MEDIUM   | To Be Implemented |
| FR-011| **Error Handling:** The API must return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for invalid requests or server errors. | HIGH     | To Be Implemented |

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

| ID     | Requirement                                       | Details                                                                 |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR-001| **Performance:** API responses for retrieving tasks should be within 500ms under normal load. | (Load: 100 concurrent users)                                            |
| NFR-002| **Security:** Adhere to OrgPolicy guidelines for data handling and API security. No sensitive data in logs. | Passwords (if any user auth added later) must be hashed. PII must be handled according to GDPR. |
| NFR-003| **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle up to 10,000 tasks without significant performance degradation. | -                                                                       |
| NFR-004| **Maintainability:** Code should be well-documented, follow consistent coding standards, and be easy to understand. | -                                                                       |
| NFR-005| **Data Integrity:** Task data must be consistent and accurate. | Foreign key constraints, data type validation.                          |

## 6. Future Considerations
- User authentication and authorization.
- Task assignment to users.
- Notifications for due dates.
- Full-text search for tasks.
